title: "JWST-TST DREAMS: Non-Uniform Dayside Emission for WASP-17b from MIRI/LRS"

permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper presents the first mid-infrared spectroscopic characterisation of the dayside atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b. We use JWST MIRI/LRS to construct and model an emission spectrum. We also construct the first eclipse map of the planet, from which we measure a significant hotspot offset of approximately 20 degrees, indicative of the presence of an equatorial zonal jet dominating the global circulation patterns.'
