I work on characterising exoplanet atmospheres using the transit method. In particular, I use secondary eclipse observations, when a transiting exoplanet is eclipsed by its host star, to characterise the daysides of these exotic worlds. I do this using two primary methods:

**(1) Emission Spectroscopy.**

Transiting exoplanets on short orbits are tidally locked to their host stars, and therefore have a permanent dayside and nightside. Just prior to secondary eclipse, the dayside of the exoplanet is facing us, and so we observe the combined light of both the planet and the star. During secondary eclipse, we only observe the light from the star; subtracting the latter from the former therefore isolates the light of the planet. By performing these measurements spectroscopically, we can examine how the planet's light changes as a function of wavelength. For a planet with no atmosphere, the spectrum would (mostly) follow a blackbody. If there is an atmosphere present, however, then we will observe deviations from this blackbody shape due to atmospheric attenuation. At short wavelengths, we observe in reflected light - starlight reflected by the planetary atmosphere. This can be used to diagnose the presence, spatial distribution, and species of clouds. At longer wavelengths, we osberve thermal emission from the planet itself, and can use these measurements to diagnose the atmospheric chemistry by observing the absorption/emission features of different chemical species, with the size of these features telling us how abundant those species are in the atmosphere. Since different wavelengths probe different altitudes of the atmosphere, these measurement can also be used to characterise the vertical temperature profile.
