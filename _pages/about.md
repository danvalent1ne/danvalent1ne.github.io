I'm a final year PhD student at the University of Bristol, where I work on characterising exoplanet atmospheres using the transit method. In particular, I use secondary eclipse observations, when a transiting exoplanet is eclipsed by its host star, to characterise the daysides of these exotic worlds. I do this using two primary methods: (1) emission spectroscopy in order to characterise the hemispherically-averaged chemistry and vertical temperature profile; and (2) eclipse mapping, which exploits the geometry of secondary eclipse with high-cadence, spectroscopic observations to map the 3D thermal profile. For more information on these techniques, see "My Research".

_Dwi'n disgybl yn blwyddyn olaf o fy PhD at Brisfysgol Briste, lle dwi'n gweithio ar deall atmosfferau allblanedau gan defnyddio y "transit method". Yn benodol, dwi'n defnyddio mesuriadau o'r eclips eilaidd, pan mae'r allblaned yn cael ei ddatguddio tu √¥l ei seren, er mwyn astudio yr hemisffer ochr dydd o'r bydoedd egsotic 'ma. Dwi'm gwneud hyn gan defnyddio dau dechneg sylfaenol: (1) "emission spectroscopy" er mwyn astudio yr cemeg hemesfferig-cyfartaleg ac y proffil tymheredd fertigol; ac (2) "eclipse mapping", sy'n defnyddio y geometreg o'r eclips efo mesuriadau cadens uchel a sbectroscopeg er mwyn mapio'r proffil tymheredd mewn 3D._

What I'm Interested In

[//]: # (The primary aim of my PhD is to use eclipse mapping in order to better understand exoplanet atmospheric dynamics, particularly how they vary across the population and what are the first-order effects that govern them. To achieve these goals, I am interested in:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (&#40;1&#41; Expanding the number of eclipse mapping observatories.)

[//]: # (Only JWST data has proven to be of sufficient calibre to successfully apply this method to multiple targets, whilst Spitzer)

[//]: # (data could only yield results for the single most optimal target, HD 189733b. The capabilities of the upcoming Ariel mission falls between the two,)

[//]: # (and so it could potentially join JWST as a vital tool for facilitating such studies. In particular, as a dedicated exoplanet mission, it has the potential for population-level mapping studies, something which JWST, as an oversubscribed general observatory, could never feasibly facilitate.)

[//]: # (As such, I spent 3 months at ESA's European Space Research and Technology Centre)

[//]: # (&#40;ESTEC&#41;, The Netherlands, as part of the ESA Archival Research Visitor Programme. There, I used existing JWST eclipse maps with simulations and analytic methods in order)

[//]: # (to assess Ariel's future eclipse mapping abilities. The results of this work are in prep, presenting the wide-ranging mapping capabilities Ariel will possess, and strategies for facilitating the most wide-ranging mapping survey to date.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (&#40;2&#41; Expanding the number of eclipse mappable planets.)

[//]: # (One limitation with eclipse mapping is that we require very optimal targets to be able to do it because the signals are very difficult to measure.)

[//]: # (In particular, we tend to favour short period planets for which we can measure entire phase curves;)

[//]: # (adding in this phase data tells us a lot about the longitudinal profile of the atmosphere as the planet rotates on its orbit, so combining that information with what we get in ingress/egress gives us much better constrained maps.)

[//]: # (But of course, asking for a full phase curve on JWST isn‚Äôt easy, and is basically impossible for planets with periods longer than a day or two.)

[//]: # (So that really limits the parameter space of targets that we can eclipse map.)

[//]: # (So in JWST cycle 3, I put in an eclipse mapping proposal with a new observing strategy that is designed to give us the highest amount of information content in our maps whilst minimising the charge time on the telescope.)

[//]: # (And the motivation behind this strategy is that, essentially, all the added benefits that a phase curve provides to our eclipse maps comes from our ability to measure the location of the peak of the phase curve, which corresponds to the longitudinal location of the hotspot.)

[//]: # (So by characterising this peak, we essentially get a second, independent measurement of the longitudinal profile, which validates and anchors our constraints from ingress/egress. )

[//]: # (This not only increases our longitudinal constraints, though, which as I showed earlier is vital for characterising the atmospheric dynamics, but it also in turn helps break degeneracies with the latitudinal signals.)

[//]: # (So by extending the pre-eclipse baseline of our light curve to capture this peak, we effectively get all the benefits of measuring a full phase curve for a fraction the observing time, which really expands the parameter space of targets that we can map with JWST.)

[//]: # (But, while this solves our longitudinal problem, it doesn‚Äôt completely fix our latitudinal problem, because it can‚Äôt break degeneracies if those signals aren‚Äôt detectable in the first place. And since latitudinal signals are localised to ingress/egress, because they‚Äôre only scanned over during eclipse, this extra phase information doesn‚Äôt increase our ability to do that.)

[//]: # (But, that means that the problem actually kind of feeds into the solution, because by observing two eclipses, we get enough of a signal boost in ingress/egress to accurately recover the latitudinal signals, and precisely because they‚Äôre localised here, we only need to boost our signal in this limited region of the light curve.)

[//]: # (So this second observation doesn‚Äôt need this long pre-eclipse baseline, and so it can be much shorter.)

[//]: # (So in total, this entire observation of two eclipses totals fewer than 20 hours of science time, whereas a full phase curve strategy would have been a minimum of 80 hours, so this gives us about a 4x improvement in efficiency.)

[//]: # (And to show you how well it works, here are the posteriors that we get out of our ability to recover the hotspot location in both longitude on the left and latitude on the right using different observing strategies.)

[//]: # (So in blue is what we‚Äôd get using the extended pre-eclipse baseline, but with only one eclipse; in orange is what we‚Äôd get from two eclipses, but with standard 1:1 baseline; and in green is the combination of the two, which makes up our optimised strategy.)

[//]: # (So you can see that, exactly as we predicted, extending our pre-eclipse baseline is what really improves our longitudinal precision here, while the addition of the 2nd eclipse is what really increases our latitudinal accuracy.)

[//]: # (So overall, our optimised strategy in green is what gives you the best results all round.)

[//]: # (So by using this strategy for future proposals, we‚Äôre really opening up the parameter space to mapping longer period planets using only a fraction of the observing time.)
