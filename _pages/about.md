I'm a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Bristol, where I work on exoplanet atmospheres using the transit method. In particular, I use secondary eclipse observations to characterise their dayside. I do this using two primary methods: (1) emission spectroscopy in order to characterise the hemispherically-averaged chemistry and temperature-pressure profile; and (2) eclipse mapping, which exploits the geometry of secondary eclipse with high-cadence, spectroscopic observations to map the 3D thermal profile, which is sculpted by the atmospheric dynamics.
